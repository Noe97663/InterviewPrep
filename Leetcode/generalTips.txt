Check if array problems would benefit from:
    - Sorting
    - Two pointers
    - Hashmaps/HashSets 
    - Dynamic Programming

Clarify what is required in the final answer.

Edge cases, check odd/even, empty, very large, etc.
Try the problem (reversed):
Left to Right, Top to bottom, Inside out, etc.

You can probably trade time complexity for space complexity if you are at/above O(n).

MENTION that you do NOT count output space in space complexity.

dict.get(s[i], 0) - returns 0 as the default value

for index,element in enumerate(array):

li = [ [0]*3 for i in range(3) ] - makes a grid matrix


from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(arg) - means that keys will have arg as default value
arg can be int (returns 0), list ([]), lambda: "Custom Default Value", etc.

A heap - complete binary tree where parent <= child nodes
