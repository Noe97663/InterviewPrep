Check if array problems would benefit from:
    - Sorting
    - Two pointers
    - Hashmaps/HashSets 

dict.get(s[i], 0) - returns 0 as the default value

for index,element in enumerate(array):

li = [ [0]*3 for i in range(3) ] - makes a grid matrix


from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(arg) - means that keys will have arg as default value
arg can be int (returns 0), list ([]), lambda: "Custom Default Value", etc.
