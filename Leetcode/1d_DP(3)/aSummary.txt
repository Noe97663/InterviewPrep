memoization - caching of recursive call values and checking the
cache before you recurse again can help

do basic DP, then look for optimization 
(like memoization or just using vars instead of table)


Either you do or you don't - O(2^n) solution
Easy to solve with recursion, can be simplified
with DP

DP can be space optimized if all the numbers in the array don't matter

Make the problem easier by splitting, truncating - solve that
