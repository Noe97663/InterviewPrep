# define a stack class where all operations run in O(1) time
# include a getMin operation that tells you the minimum in the stack

## brute force - O(n) for getMin with a linear search
## 2 stack - use a 2nd stack that keeps track of the min with each
##           element added - O(1), O(n)
## 1 stack -
