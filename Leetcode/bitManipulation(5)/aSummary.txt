do bit manipulation questions in java or C since it's not 
as straightforward in Python

XOR with the same number gives zero

n >> 1 divides a number by 2 in python

n = n & (n-1) removes 1 1-bit from n

bit manipulation operators in Java,Python:
bitshifts  <<, >> 
(zeroes fill in Python)
(<< fills zeroes in Java)
(>> fills in left digit in Java)
AND  &
OR  |
Complement  ~
